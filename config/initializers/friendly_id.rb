# FriendlyId Global Configuration

  #  ## Friendly Finders
  config.use :finders

  # ## Slugs
  config.use :slugged

  # By default, FriendlyId's :slugged addon expects the slug column to be named
  # 'slug', but you can change it if you wish.
  #
  # config.slug_column = 'slug'
  #
  # When FriendlyId can not generate a unique ID from your base method, it appends
  # a UUID, separated by a single dash. You can configure the character used as the
  # separator. If you're upgrading from FriendlyId 4, you may wish to replace this
  # with two dashes.
  #
  # config.sequence_separator = '-'
  #
  #  ## Tips and Tricks
  #
  #  ### Controlling when slugs are generated
  #
  # As of FriendlyId 5.0, new slugs are generated only when the slug field is
  # nil, but if you're using a column as your base method can change this
  # behavior by overriding the `should_generate_new_friendly_id` method that
  # FriendlyId adds to your model. The change below makes FriendlyId 5.0 behave
  # more like 4.0.
  #
  # config.use Module.new {
  #   def should_generate_new_friendly_id?
  #     slug.blank? || <your_column_name_here>_changed?
  #   end
  # }
  #
  # FriendlyId uses Rails's `parameterize` method to generate slugs, but for
  # languages that don't use the Roman alphabet, that's not usually sufficient.
  # Here we use the Babosa library to transliterate Russian Cyrillic slugs to
  # ASCII. If you use this, don't forget to add "babosa" to your Gemfile.
  #
  # config.use Module.new {
  #   def normalize_friendly_id(text)
  #     text.to_slug.normalize! :transliterations => [:russian, :latin]
  #   end
  # }
end
